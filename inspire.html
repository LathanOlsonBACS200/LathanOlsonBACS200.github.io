        <h2>Why is Matthew McConaughey an Inspiration?</h2>
        <p>Not only is Matthew Mcconaughey an actor in my favorite film of all time, he also has become an author to an inspiring autobiography called Greenlights.</p>
        <p>In his remarkable novel McConaughey not only dives into his past, but lessons he wants to share to those willing to accept them. The book is called Greenlights, which is a analogy for "catching more greenlights in a world full of red ones". In this novel the resilience and determination of Matthew in his past give insight into how he has become the inspiration he is today.</p>
